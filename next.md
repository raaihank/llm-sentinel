Short answer: yes. It solves a real problem with low integration effort. You’ve packaged it well for a hiring signal on the Director/Head/CTO track.

Here’s how to level it up fast.

# What’s strong

* Drop-in proxy for OpenAI and Ollama
* Streaming masking
* Clear CLI + Docker + SDK snippets
* Real-time dashboard
* Rule toggles and debug mode

# Gaps to close before you promote it

1. **License blocks adoption**
   Your “Custom License” stops companies from trying it.
   Options:

* Switch to Apache-2.0 or MIT and sell commercial support
* Or keep the current license but add a clear “Commercial” contact path and example terms

2. **Latency and throughput numbers**
   Publish a tiny benchmark:

* p50/p95 overhead at 50, 200, 1k rps
* End-to-end masking time
* CPU and memory at each load level
  Add a simple `llmsentinel bench` that hits a local echo server.

3. **Detector quality**
   Show precision/recall for 10 common entities:

* Email, phone, credit card, AWS key, SSH key, JWT, DB URL, SSN, IP, OpenAI key
  Include false positive/negative notes and redaction format.

4. **Security model + threat surface**
   Document:

* Runs locally only, no outbound calls
* What lands in logs after masking
* Header handling and key redaction path
* Threat model and known non-goals
  Add a “safe by default” config preset.

5. **Ops-ready**

* `/metrics` for Prometheus
* `/ready` and `/live` endpoints
* Helm chart and Docker Compose
* Example reverse proxy in Nginx and Traefik
* Structured JSON logs with event IDs

6. **Compatibility matrix**
   Table with tested SDKs and features:

* OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, Cohere, Ollama
* Chat, embeddings, images, streaming

7. **DX polish**

* Homebrew tap: `brew install llm-sentinel`
* Prebuilt binaries for macOS, Linux, Windows
* Config schema with comments and env var overrides
* Safer command: make `no-protect` require `--force`

# README upgrades (fast wins)

* Add badges: version, CI, license, Docker pulls
* “Before/After” table
* 30-sec GIF of the dashboard
* One-page architecture diagram
* Quickstart matrix: Local, Docker, Kubernetes
* Example policy pack: “PII-only”, “Keys-only”, “Strict”

Example “Before/After” block:

```
Input:  "My AWS key AKIA... and db postgresql://user:pass@host/db"
After:  "My AWS key [AWS_ACCESS_KEY_MASKED] and db postgresql://[USER]:[PASS]@host/db"
```

# API and integrations to add next

* **/mask** endpoint for libraries to call directly without proxying
* **Middleware** for FastAPI and Express that wraps your /mask
* **Webhook** on detection events for SIEM routing
* **Audit export**: NDJSON with redacted fields only

# Scorecard to track publicly

* Latency overhead p50/p95 at N rps
* % requests with a detection
* Detector precision/recall by type
* Cache hit % for compiled regex or detectors
* Uptime and error rate
* Test coverage %

# Backlog you can open as GitHub issues

* Helm chart and Docker Compose
* `/metrics` with basic counters and histograms
* Detector packs and a rule-set presets folder
* Benchmark tool and sample report
* Homebrew formula and binary releases
* Compatibility tests CI against OpenAI and Ollama
* Safe default for logs with `showDetectedEntity=false`
* `--force` guard for `no-protect`

# LinkedIn post draft (Week 3–4 “proof”)

Use this to showcase LLM-Sentinel and your cost/compliance narrative.

**Title:** AI API calls leak secrets more often than you think

**Post:**

* I shipped **LLM-Sentinel**, a privacy-first proxy for AI APIs.
* It detects 52 secret types and masks them in real time.
* Drop-in: change `base_url` to `http://localhost:5050/openai/v1` or `.../ollama`.
* Streaming supported. Zero data retention. Keys redacted in headers and logs.
* Next up: Prometheus `/metrics`, Helm chart, detector precision/recall report, latency bench.
* Repo link in comments.

**Comment with code:**

```python
client = openai.OpenAI(api_key="sk-...", base_url="http://localhost:5050/openai/v1")
client.chat.completions.create(
  model="gpt-4o-mini",
  messages=[{"role":"user","content":"ssh-rsa AAAAB3... and email jane@acme.com"}],
  stream=True
)
# Model sees masked values
```

# One-pager copy for the repo top

**LLM-Sentinel**
Privacy-first proxy that detects and masks secrets before they reach AI models, with near-zero integration effort.

* 52 detectors. Streaming safe. Local-only by default.
* Works with OpenAI and Ollama today.
* CLI, Docker, and dashboard included.

**Why teams use it**

* Stop accidental key and PII leaks in prompts
* Keep logs clean for audits
* Add protection without SDK rewrites

**What’s measured**

* p50/p95 overhead
* Detection counts and types
* Masking time
* Uptime

# Final verdict

Useful and market-relevant. Ship the four upgrades below this week to unblock adoption and raise your leadership signal:

1. Standard OS license or clear commercial path
2. Latency and throughput benchmarks
3. Detector accuracy report
4. Prometheus metrics and Helm chart

Want me to turn this into:

* A PRD checklist for the next release
* A README rewrite with the sections above
* A Helm chart starter with `/metrics` and readiness probes
