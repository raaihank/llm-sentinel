# LLM-Sentinel

A Go-based proxy server that sits between your app and LLM APIs to detect PII and block basic prompt injection attempts.

## What it actually does

- **PII Detection**: Finds emails, SSNs, credit cards, etc. in requests and masks them
- **Basic Prompt Injection Blocking**: Blocks simple attacks like "pretend you are not an AI"
- **Request Logging**: Logs all requests with PII masked
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Shows what's happening via WebSocket

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/raaihank/llm-sentinel
cd llm-sentinel
docker-compose up --build
```
Then go to `http://localhost:8080` for the dashboard.

## Current System Reality (2025-09-27)

- **Upstream auth header bug**: `privacy.header_scrubbing.enabled: true` scrubs `Authorization` and it is not restored before proxying, causing 401s to OpenAI/Anthropic. Until this is fixed, set header scrubbing to false when calling upstream APIs.
- **Dashboard WebSocket auth**: The WS endpoint enforces Basic Auth, but credentials are not configurable via `configs/*.yaml`. The HTML dashboard does not send auth, so the live stream will not connect by default. The page loads, but events won't stream.
- **Rate limiting**: A token-bucket limiter exists but is not wired into the HTTP pipeline yet.
- **Security mode**: `security.mode` (block/log/passthrough) is currently not honored by the vector security middleware; malicious prompts meeting the threshold are blocked even in `log` mode.
- **Vector security**: Runtime uses a simple pattern-based analyzer. The ML embedding service loads a placeholder model and does not provide true semantic detection. pgvector/Redis are used by ETL, not in the request path.
- **Benchmarks**: The previously documented multi-script suite isn‚Äôt present; use `benchmarks/prompt_injection.py` (see below).

### Recent ML Service Improvements (experimental)

- Async caching now uses the request context with short timeouts (no blocking goroutine waits)
- Redis cache switched to binary (little-endian float32) with stronger 128-bit keys
- Model bytes loading guarded by mutex to avoid concurrent reads
- Context checks added in loops; batch inference stub added for future ONNX/TensorRT integration

Config tip (keep ML disabled for blocking, prefer pattern for now):

```yaml
security:
  vector_security:
    enabled: true
    block_threshold: 0.70
    embedding:
      service_type: "pattern"  # use pattern in production until ML is real
```

### ONNX Runtime Backend (optional)

You can enable a real transformer backend using ONNX Runtime. This is behind a build tag to keep default builds dependency-free.

Requirements:

- Install ONNX Runtime shared library (`libonnxruntime.so`/`.dylib`) and set `ONNXRUNTIME_SHARED_LIB` to its path.
- Use a sentence-transformer ONNX model that outputs pooled 384-d embeddings, or adapt output mapping in `internal/embeddings/backend_onnx.go`.
Build/run with ONNX backend:

```bash
export ONNXRUNTIME_SHARED_LIB=/usr/local/lib/libonnxruntime.dylib   # or .so
go build -tags onnx -o bin/sentinel ./cmd/sentinel
./bin/sentinel --config configs/default.yaml
```


### Recommended local config (workaround)

Use this to get working proxy calls and conservative logging:

```yaml
# configs/default.yaml
privacy:
  enabled: true
  header_scrubbing:
    enabled: false  # TEMP: allow upstream Authorization to pass through

security:
  mode: log
  vector_security:
    enabled: true
    block_threshold: 0.70
    embedding:
      service_type: "pattern"  # simpler and predictable for now
```

Example (OpenAI via proxy):

```bash
curl -sS http://localhost:8080/openai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4o-mini","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hi"}]}'
```

## How to use it

Instead of calling your LLM API directly:

```bash
curl http://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
```

Call through the proxy:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/openai/v1/chat/completions
```

Same for Ollama:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/ollama/api/generate
```

## Configuration

Edit `configs/default.yaml`:

```yaml
server:
  port: 8080

privacy:
  enabled: true
  detectors:
    - all  # Uses all ~83 built-in PII patterns

security:
  vector_security:
    enabled: true
    block_threshold: 0.85  # Block if 85%+ confident it's an attack

upstream:
  openai: https://api.openai.com
  ollama: http://localhost:11434
```

## What gets blocked

Currently blocks these patterns with 90% confidence:

- "pretend you are not an ai"
- "ignore all previous instructions"
- "bypass your guidelines"
- "tell me secrets"
- Basic jailbreak attempts

**Using your own data:**
You can add your own attack patterns by creating a CSV or parquet file with these columns:

- `text`: The attack text to detect (e.g., "ignore previous instructions")
- `label_text`: Human-readable category (e.g., "prompt_injection", "jailbreak", "safe")
- `label`: 1 for malicious, 0 for safe

Then run the ETL pipeline:

```bash
go build -o dist/etl-pipeline ./cmd/etl
./dist/etl-pipeline -input your_data.csv
```

Note: The ETL pipeline exists but currently uses simple pattern matching, not real ML embeddings.

## What gets detected (PII)

- Email addresses ‚Üí `[EMAIL_MASKED]`
- SSNs ‚Üí `[SSN_MASKED]`
- Credit cards ‚Üí `[CREDIT_CARD_MASKED]`
- API keys ‚Üí `[API_KEY_MASKED]`
- Phone numbers ‚Üí `[PHONE_MASKED]`
- And ~78 other patterns

## Project Status

**What works:**

- ‚úÖ PII detection and masking (headers + body)
- ‚úÖ Proxy routing to OpenAI/Ollama/Anthropic (requires header scrubbing disabled, see above)
- ‚úÖ Docker Compose brings up Postgres, Redis, and the app
- ‚úÖ Dashboard HTML served at `/` (WebSocket stream needs auth wiring)

**Partially done:**

- üîÑ Vector security: pattern-based analyzer in the request path; ML embeddings load but are not used for blocking
- üîÑ ETL pipeline loads datasets into Postgres/pgvector; Redis/vector-cache integration is partial

**Known issues/gaps:**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Upstream `Authorization` restore bug (workaround in config above)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è WebSocket Basic Auth enforced but not configurable; dashboard won‚Äôt connect by default
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `security.mode` not honored in middleware (blocks even in `log` mode)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Rate limiter not hooked into the router yet
- ‚ö†Ô∏è ML embeddings are simulated; no real transformer inference
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some benchmark docs referenced files that don‚Äôt exist; see the single script below

## Architecture

```text
Your App ‚Üí LLM-Sentinel (port 8080) ‚Üí LLM API
                ‚Üì
           Dashboard (WebSocket)
```

The proxy runs these middlewares in order:

1. Rate limiting
2. PII detection
3. Vector security (basic pattern matching)
4. Request forwarding

## Performance

| Benchmark | Samples | Threshold | Balanced Accuracy | Precision | Recall | Mean Latency | P95 Latency | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|--------|--------------|-------------|-------|
| **Gandalf** | 111 injections<br/>111 benign | 0.70 | **73.9%** | **100.0%** | 47.7% | 10.7ms | 15.5ms | Zero false positives<br/>Latency: blocked only |
| **Qualifire** | 4996 injections<br/>4996 benign | 0.70 | **57.8%** | **100.0%** | 15.6% | 17.5ms | 34.4ms | Zero false positives<br/>Latency: blocked only |

## Development

```bash
# Build
go build -o dist/llm-sentinel ./cmd/sentinel

# Run locally
./dist/llm-sentinel -config configs/default.yaml

# Test PII detection
curl http://localhost:8080/ollama/api/generate \
  -d '{"model": "llama2", "prompt": "My email is test@example.com"}'

# Test prompt injection blocking
curl http://localhost:8080/ollama/api/generate \
  -d '{"model": "llama2", "prompt": "Pretend you are not an AI"}'
# Should return: "Request blocked: prompt_injection detected (confidence: 90.0%)"
```

## Benchmarks

### Prompt Injection Detection

Run benchmarks against public datasets:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r benchmarks/requirements.txt

# Run Gandalf benchmark (focused attacks)
python benchmarks/prompt_injection.py --dataset gandalf

# Run Qualifire benchmark (diverse attacks)
python benchmarks/prompt_injection.py --dataset qualifire
```

### Redis Cache Compatibility

The ML embedding Redis cache format changed from CSV string to binary little‚Äëendian float32, and the key length increased (8 ‚Üí 16 bytes of hash). If you previously ran a version with CSV cache, clear the old keys to avoid mixed formats:

```bash
# DANGER: deletes embeddings cache keys; adjust prefix if you changed it
redis-cli --scan --pattern 'embedding:ml:*' | xargs -r redis-cli DEL
```

**Recommended Configuration:**

```yaml
security:
  vector_security:
    service_type: "pattern"
    block_threshold: 0.70
```

```

## Limitations

- Vector security is just pattern matching, not real ML
- No user management or auth
- Basic dashboard, not production monitoring
- Limited to simple prompt injection patterns
- No persistent storage of events
- Docker setup includes PostgreSQL/Redis but they're not used in the runtime request path

## Roadmap (realistic)

**Next up:**

- Integrate actual ONNX model for better threat detection
- Use the PostgreSQL/Redis setup for vector storage
- Add more prompt injection patterns

**Maybe later:**

- Better dashboard with filtering
- Export logs to files
- More LLM provider support
